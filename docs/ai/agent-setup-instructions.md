# Claude Code Agents Setup Instructions

## Overview

This guide provides step-by-step instructions for setting up four specialized Claude Code agents that continuously analyze your repository and maintain review reports. Each agent has a specific focus area and collaborates with other agents when needed.

## Prerequisites

1. **Claude Code** installed and configured
2. Repository with the following structure:

   ```ini
   /
   ├── docs/
   │   ├── README.md              # Documentation index
   │   ├── best-practice.md       # Documentation standards
   │   ├── PRD.md                # Product Requirements Document
   │   ├── architecture/
   │   │   └── best-practices.md  # Architecture guidelines
   │   ├── security/             # Security documentation
   │   │   ├── authentication.md
   │   │   ├── authorization.md
   │   │   ├── data-protection.md
   │   │   └── threat-model.md
   │   └── templates/            # Agent templates (created below)
   │       ├── architect-template.md
   │       ├── qa-template.md
   │       ├── author-template.md
   │       └── devops-template.md
   ├── .taskmaster/              # Task management directory
   ├── Taskfile.yml             # go-task configuration
   └── .github/
       └── workflows/         # GitHub Actions workflows
   ```

3. **Tools installed**:
   - `task` (go-task)
   - `task-master` CLI
   - Testing frameworks
   - Linting tools
   - Security scanning tools (SonarCloud, Snyk)

## Step 1: Create Template Directory

First, create the templates directory and add the agent templates:

```bash
mkdir -p docs/templates
```

Copy each template file from this guide into the `docs/templates/` directory:

- `architect-template.md`
- `qa-template.md`
- `author-template.md`
- `devops-template.md`

## Step 2: Create Agent Instructions

For each agent, create an instruction file that Claude Code will use. Create a `.claude-agents/` directory:

```bash
mkdir -p .claude-agents
```

### Create Architect Agent Instructions

Create `.claude-agents/architect.md`:

```markdown

````markdown
## Step 3: Initialize Agents

Run these commands to create each agent in Claude Code:

```bash
# Create the Architect agent
claude-code agent create architect \
  --instructions .claude-agents/architect.md \
  --description "Architecture review and code quality analysis"

# Create the QA agent
claude-code agent create qa \
  --instructions .claude-agents/qa.md \
  --description "Quality assurance and testing oversight"

# Create the Author agent
claude-code agent create author \
  --instructions .claude-agents/author.md \
  --description "Technical documentation management"

# Create the DevOps agent
claude-code agent create devops \
  --instructions .claude-agents/devops.md \
  --description "Build, deployment, and infrastructure optimization"
```
````

## Step 4: Configure Agent Triggers

Set up agents to run automatically:

### Option 1: Scheduled Reviews

Create `.claude-agents/schedule.yml`:

```yaml
agents:
  architect:
    schedule: "0 9 * * MON" # Weekly on Monday
    triggers:
      - pattern: "src/**/*.{js,ts,py,go}"
        events: ["change"]
        threshold: 10 # files changed

  qa:
    schedule: "0 9 * * *" # Daily
    triggers:
      - pattern: "**/*test*"
        events: ["change"]
      - pattern: ".github/workflows/*"
        events: ["change"]

  author:
    schedule: "0 9 * * WED" # Weekly on Wednesday
    triggers:
      - pattern: "docs/**/*"
        events: ["change"]
      - pattern: "README.md"
        events: ["change"]

  devops:
    schedule: "0 9 * * TUE,THU" # Twice weekly
    triggers:
      - pattern: "Taskfile.yml"
        events: ["change"]
      - pattern: ".github/workflows/*"
        events: ["change"]
```

### Option 2: Git Hook Integration

Create `.git/hooks/pre-push`:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Run quick agent checks before push

echo "Running agent quick checks..."

# Quick architecture check
claude-code agent run architect --quick-check

# Quick QA check
claude-code agent run qa --quick-check

# Documentation check
claude-code agent run author --verify-links

# CI validation
task ci:validate
```

## Step 5: Manual Agent Execution

Run agents manually when needed:

```bash
# Run individual agents
claude-code agent run architect
claude-code agent run qa
claude-code agent run author
claude-code agent run devops

# Run all agents
claude-code agent run --all

# Run with specific focus
claude-code agent run architect --focus security
claude-code agent run qa --focus coverage
```

## Step 6: Inter-Agent Communication

Set up agent collaboration:

Create `.claude-agents/collaboration.yml`:

```yaml
collaborations:
  critical_quality_issue:
    from: qa
    to: architect
    condition: "critical security vulnerability OR coverage < 80%"

  documentation_gap:
    from: author
    to: [architect, qa, devops]
    condition: "missing documentation for new feature"

  deployment_blocker:
    from: devops
    to: [qa, architect]
    condition: "deployment failure rate > 10%"
```

## Step 7: Monitoring Agent Performance

Track agent effectiveness:

```bash
# View agent activity
claude-code agent status --all

# View agent logs
claude-code agent logs architect --tail 50

# View agent metrics
claude-code agent metrics --period 30d
```

## Best Practices

1. **Regular Reviews**: Run agents at least weekly
2. **Action Items**: Address P0 and P1 items immediately
3. **Trend Analysis**: Monitor metrics over time
4. **Continuous Improvement**: Update templates based on needs
5. **Team Integration**: Share reports in team meetings

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Agent not finding files**

   - Check file permissions
   - Verify working directory
   - Update path configurations

2. **Template not loading**

   - Verify template path
   - Check template syntax
   - Ensure proper markdown formatting

3. **Tools not available**
   - Install required CLI tools
   - Update PATH environment
   - Check tool versions

### Debug Mode

Run agents in debug mode for troubleshooting:

```bash
claude-code agent run architect --debug
```

## Customization

### Adding New Checks

1. Update the agent template
2. Modify agent instructions
3. Add new tool integrations
4. Update collaboration rules

### Custom Metrics

Add custom metrics to track in each template:

- Business-specific KPIs
